        Avengers is a compilation album by the American punk group Avengers.
        <br>
         It was released on vinyl in 1983 by CD Presents. It is the closest thing  <br> 
         to a studio album the band has, although it was compiled by drummer Danny Furious from various recordings  <br>  
         the band did in their three years of existence.[2]  <br>

         The album includes some songs previously released, including all of the songs  <br>
           from the We Are the One EP, two songs from the Avengers  <br>

          first released on cassette by CD Presents with two more tracks; the 1989 release on CD included the same bonus tracks.  <br> 
          In 2000, Lady Butcher released the album on CD with 10 bonus tracks[4] that were recorded live at the Whisky a Go Go in  <br>
           Los Angeles, California, in August 1978.[5][unreliable source?] Sometime by 2003, singer Penelope Houston was selling  <br>
            CD-R copies of the album on her website.[6] In 2010, CD Presents re-released the album through online music stores such as iTunes Store and Amazon MP3  <br> 
            and on CD only through Amazon.com featuring four alternate takes[7] although this release appears to have been pulled due to  <br>
             a rights issues from Penelope Houston.[8] In 2012 Water Music Records re-released the compilation as a 2-CD set, with the fir  <br>
